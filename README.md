# Japan's Airbnb Analysis as of March 2024

### Project Overview

This project's objective is to provide insights on the number of listings Tokyo, Japan has to offer. Prices vary depending on where the listing is located and what type of room the listing is. We will dive into the dataset to find which areas are generally lower than the average price or which ones are above. Prices are per night. We will also look to see which areas are generally more popular than others. These findings could lead to strong decision-making for locals and tourists in finding rooms for their vacation. Prices may flucuate at times so prices may not be 100% accurate from March 2024 onwards. 

### About the Data

The primary dataset can be found on <https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/>. The provided csv file is labeled listings.csv.gz

### Tools Used

- SQL - Data Cleaning & Data Analysis
- Tableau - Data Visualization

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

1. Data loading and Joining
2. Data Cleaning and Sorting
3. Data Formatting and Transforming

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to answer key questions, such as, but not limited to:

1. Which areas have the most amount of listings, which have the least?
2. What are the average prices per listing in Boston?
3. Which area has more reviews per month?
4. Which area has the most reviews?

### Results/Findings

1. Dorchester appears to have the most amount of listings being 528. Whereas, Leather District has the least amount of listings in Boston being 9.
2. The average prices across Boston is $187.59. Average prices per neighbourhood range from $126 - $352 a night.
3. Downtown Boston has the highest reviews per month being at 3. This could indicate that Downtown is a popular area to find an airbnb. Generally speaking, the more reviews, the more customers have chosen a particular airbnb over another.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

Booking an airbnb in the areas of **Downtown** and **Dorchester** appears to be a great choice. Both of these areas have above average amount of listings so finding an airbnb should not be a challenge. Average prices for Dorchester is significantly lower than Boston's overall average so it is also cost-efficient. Downtown's average prices is above the overall average but having the second most amount of reviews may justify the cost. 

### Limitations

This dataset did not provide any dates/timestamps so it was hard to make comparative analyses. We would need to find data regarding **time** to make a more induced analysis for decision-making. Having this data would be useful in finding price changes from time to time in certain areas and room types, total amount of reviews per month per neighbourhood, or making monthly, quarterly, seasonal analyses. Having information regarding **number of bedrooms, beds, bathrooms** would definitely be useful data that can be used as a KPI.
